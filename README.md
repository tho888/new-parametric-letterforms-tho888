## MDDN 242 2024 Assignment 2

(Replace this README with information about your alphabet. This is an example.)

Each of my letters is composed with two circles. The size and position of the first circle is fixed, but the location and size of the second circle is controlled by three parameters.

The three parameters per letter:
  * `size` : radius of the second circle
  * `offsetx` : x offset of the second circle relative to the first one
  * `offsety` : y offset of the second circle relative to the first one

### PROGRESS DOCUMENTATION / CHANGELOG

##### 25/03/24 - 31/03/24 *(Week 5)*

- Started working on `sketch.js`
- Experimenting with different parameters to add stems to lowercase letters 'a' and 'b'

___

##### 01/04/24 - 03/04/24 *(Week 6)*

- Continued experimentation, trying out an arabic-style typeface similar to [this one](https://www.dafont.com/img/charmap/a/l/alhambra0.png)
- This proved to be too difficul - creating curved line parameters that worked for each letter

___

##### 15/04/24 - 21/04/24 *(Week 7)*

- Testing out a new idea, initially aimed for a cryllic-style typeface but landed on an idea that loosely resembled a seven-segment LED, with a total of 8 drawn lines ()
- Experimented with a custom line function to draw a dotted path in place of a line
- [Completed initial draft of alphabet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tho888/new-parametric-letterforms-tho888/20e5330451f20b0df8cfafa50e68c02fa0d35801/preview.jpg)

___

##### 22/04/24 - 28/04/24 *(Week 8)*

- Consolidated variables to cut down to < 20 in total
- Updated colours and fixed layering issues
- Adjusted variable names to be more intelligible

___

##### 29/04/24 - 02/05/24 *(Week 9)*
